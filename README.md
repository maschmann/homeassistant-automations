# Home Assistant automation blueprints

This is a collection of blueprints for Home Assistant and features a variety of solutions I came across or developed myself while migrating from openHAB3, reimplementing what I had there.  

* Remote control scenarios, triggering lights, groups and switches,
* Open/close with notifications
* Timers for switches or motion detection

The whole migration story is listed [here](https://aschmann.dev/2021/11/22/homeassistant/)
